    <b> Lesson 1:Welcome to CPS</b>
    <h4> Starting out in Computer Science:
    Computer science has changed the way we communicate with each other, make art and movies, grow food, and even treat illnesses. Everyone can learn computer science and make a difference.
      
      Reflect and Summarize:
      What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?
      
      My strategies for learning is not that different from the other students it is pretty similar, I would be really attentive in class and write note on my device so it would be easier to remember paying attention in class even if I am tired I would write note down and review it.

    <b> Lesson 2: Representing information</b>
    <h4> Reflection: Sending Complex Messages
    Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options? When we were building our sending device we decided to flip the stick, one side of the stick is green which represent YES to any answer, and the other side of the stick is pink which also represent NO to any question</h4>

    <b> Lesson 3: Circle square</b>
    <h4> Counting in Binary
    How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before? Numbers are used for counting, measuring, and comparing amounts. A number system is a set of symbols, or numerals, that are used to represent numbers

    <b>Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</b>
    <h4> Reflecting on Programming, Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have? The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system. Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make? Each time we add another bit, We can double the amount of number we make. What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?Decimal systems counting by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 while binary system has two numbers 0,1. </h4>

    <b>Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding</b>
    <h4>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?The odometer resets to zero when a car drives beyond the odometers maximum reading possible( a million miles).When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not? When using bits to represent fractions of a number, you cannot create all possible fractions. This is due to the fact that there are numbers that are too large or too small to be able to be represented.</h4>

    <b>Lesson 6: Representing Text</b>
    <h4>In this part we created variables to represent text to code it</h4>

    <b>Lesson 7: Black and White Images</b>
    <h4>Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image?Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken.Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?The  sample size that I would use is 24 bits because , I would sample the image by creating a small image to fit "4 x 6". The digital representation would not come out perfect but it would be an image that would fit,

    <b>Lesson 8: Color Images</b>
    <h4>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.RGB pixel and binary sequences work together by making the shade or color we want.Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.</h4>

    <b>Lesson 9: Lossless Compression </b>
    <h4>What is the most important quality of lossless compression? The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.</h4>
    <!--Q&A-->
    <hr>
    <b>Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</b>
    <h4>Youâ€™ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why? Lossy compression because it is not reversible  the 2 gigabyte is not reversible</h4>

    <b>Lesson 11: Intellectual Property</b>
    <h4>How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?  It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</h4>
    <!--Q&A-->
    <hr>
    <b>Lesson 12: Project Digital Informations Dilemamas</b>
    <h4>What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs? Provides information and allows for people to access to the artwork and it is decreasing website traffic. Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally? because digital information can be false</h4>
