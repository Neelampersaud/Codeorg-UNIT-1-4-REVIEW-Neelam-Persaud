     <b>Lesson 6: Conditionals Investigate </b>
     <h5> When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below. What does it mean to put the most specific case first?
     Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid? Putting the most specific case first in an if-else-if statement is important because it helps ensure that the conditions are evaluated in the correct order. To put the most specific case first means to prioritzie the condition that has the narrowest ormost precise criteria. By doing so, you increase the likelihood that the program will produce the correct output and aviod any errors.</h5>
