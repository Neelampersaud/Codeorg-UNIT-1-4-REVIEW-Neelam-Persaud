        <b>Unit 1</b>
        <hr> 
        <p> In unit one I learned about the basic HTML. I learned that there is a difference between a webpage and website. A web page is a document on the world wide web and a website is a set of web pages that are joined together.I learned about the different tags that are used to create a website. Some of the tags are The p tag is to start a paragraphs. You can also change the size of your text with the h1,h1,h3,h4,h5,h6, where h1 is the biggest text and h6 is the smallest. All this information is in the body tag section. HTML Hypertext Markup Language,a language used to create web pages HTML Element-A piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag HTML Tag- the special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element’s type Website content-the text and image on a website Website structure-how the content of a website is organized . I also learned about lossless and lossy compression., lossless compression is a process for reducing the numbers of bits needed to represent something without losing any information, this process is reversible. Lossy compression  process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent something in which some information is lost or thrown away this process is not reversible.CSS used to style the layout for example size, color,fonts, spacing and add decorative features. CSS is important because it controls how our web page looks.

    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <hr> 
    <p> 
    In unit two we learned about the internet and how and why people need the internet.I also learned how the internet is connected. I started learning about computing networks. It is a group of connected devices that share and communicate resources with each other. It is important because it will help others discover new things like research and it enables communication. It is used to help share resources to other devices, it also helps fast communication so computers can transfer resources faster. I also learned about Bandwidth  and path. Path is a connection between a computing device's network starting with a sender and the receiver at the end, and a bandwidth is used  to send an amount of information that can be transferred from a server to a user. And I also learned about protocol, it is how data is exchanged between devices. For example communication. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol. I also learned what an IP Address is. It is a set of numbers that identify a device in order for other devices to send data to that device. It is used for internet communication. A Digital Divide  is a piece of physical equipment that uses digital data, it processes, retrieves and stores data. Things like computers, phones, tablets,TV stc all store a lot of things.  I also understand how the internet is spread and it is through something called a router. It is a type of device that connects to a packet-switch . It forwards data across a network.

    <b>Unit 3</b>
    <hr> 
    <p> In unit three we learned how to make an app of our choice, and also tested the app on how it works. During learning about apps I learned about inputs and outputs. Inputs are buttons that the user clicked for the app to do what its program to do. I also learned about the user interface and it is used for. In this unit we had to code an app that was already created for us. For me coding this app is easy but the only hard part was trying to figure out what had to be coded. I also learned about console.log  output information in the debug console, Numerical characters have a value when the are not inside quotes Characters in quotes are called strings console.log(3+5); console.log("3+5"); If you write characters (letters, number ) but there is no quotes the computer will treat them as variables.

    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <hr> 
    <p>  In unite four we learned about variables condition and function. I learned a lot of vocabulary and it made me understand the lesson even more. I learned how to design my own app and code it all by myself. I learned about variables. It is like a container that can store different types of data, like numbers, text.Variables allow programmers to   manipulate data throughout their code. I also learned a lot about expression. It refers to the visual representation and arrangement of elements on a website. It involves using colors, images and layouts. Assignment operator allows you to store data within your web design code. Example var x=10. An algorithm is a sequence of well defined instructions used to solve a problem or perform an action.      It is just a bunch of steps/statements. If you write more than 2 lines of code that complete an action without problems. Sequencing in  Algorithm A sequence is a list of instructions where the order matters. I learned how to create a string. It is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. It Is Used to store and manipulate textual data, such as words, sentences and even paragraphs.String is commonly used for tasks like displaying text on the screen, storing user input, or processing textual data. I also learned about elements. Quantitative data is data that’s numeric. It could be the number of customers with a savings account or interest rates on different types of loans. Qualitative data is non-numeric data. That’s often the result of open-ended collection, such as feedback on a financial institution’s customer service.Primary data is data that a person or business collects themselves. It could be data a financial company collects about its own customers through a survey.Secondary data is data that is collected and analyzed by another source. It includes data a financial company finds about someone else’s data, such as information another company shares online. One way to collect secondary data is through web scraping using an automated tool to collect publicly available data online.
